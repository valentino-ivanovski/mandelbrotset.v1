# mandelbrotset.v1
This is a project developed by Valentino Ivanovski for the Computer Science course Programming III, at UP FAMNIT in 2023.
## Setup (Instructions only for IntelliJ Idea)
1. Download the "javafx-sdk-19" folder that's in the repository.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ Idea and head over to File â€“> Project Structure.
3. Click on Libraries and then on the little plus button at the top left, next to the sidebar.
4. Select Java and head over to where you've stored your "javafx-sdk-19" folder. Open it and head over to "lib". Inside, search for a file named javafx.swing. Add it as a library.
5. Next, you need to add the entire folder named "lib" as a library. Same process as above, just select the entire folder.
6. The program should be working now.
